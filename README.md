# Arduino-with-P10-Display
A P10 LED Display Module is the most suitable for designing any size of outdoor or indoor LED display advertisement board. ex: The 32*16 module size means that there are 32 LEDs in each row and 16 LEDs in each column. So there is a total of 512 numbers of LEDs present in each module unit. It can fully control with Arduino microcontroller or similar boards.
